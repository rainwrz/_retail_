Steffen Buehl:
	- allow colors in ldb text (format: =rrggbb=text==), display ldb custom text as multiline config option
	- show invasions when buildings are collapsed
	- inn tracking by hook/event ("recruitment") - api doesn't return correct values if the headhunter ui isn't open
	- fix #64 (characters appearing in wrong config category / realm)
	- don'T disable libsink options
	- show summary on every login when enabled, change seal of tempered fate icon
	- parse "unknown" mission times and write calculated start time to SVs (e.g. started on another machine)
