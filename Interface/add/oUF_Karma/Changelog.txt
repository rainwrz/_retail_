Fixed max resources for warlocks

10-05-2013 ver 1.6.1r
Fixed Warlock Bars
Boss Frames Health Should update Properly (the bars at least - the text % might not show as accurate until you target the bosses - please let me know any other bugs)


09-28-2013 ver 1.6.0r
Fulled updated to 1.6+ .... yeah I know I am slow...
Shamans - sorry guys gotta find another way to track your totems I don't have time right now to rewrite things to work for you all... Suggest WeakAuras or PowerAuras
Fixed some oddities going on with the party/raid frames
Fixed Debuff Highlighting - hey I may not use the party/raid frames but you all might :)
Class Bars - Priests, Warlocks, Palis & Monks now have class colored class power bars. 
	Also if you haven't noticed before if you switch talent/spec that gives you more/less of your secondary power type you need to reload
Getting rid of some stuff not used... if you use it and its gone let me know (mainly outdated plugin stuff)

05-30-2013 ver 1.5.38r
Castbar error fix
Works fine with 5.3 might still show out of date since I didn't update ui version

11-27-2012
Update so it doesnt read out of date.
Fixed Monk SPELL_POWER_LIGHT_FORCE to SPELL_POWER_CHI and now everything should be working correctly with patch 5.1

11-14-2012
New cfg option. Target Power Value... Shown to right of target power bar, directly beneath buffs for target.
Also added Soothing Mists ticks for Monks. I needed it, thought others might as well.

10-02-2012
Nothing major. Few tweaks to party frames and oUF to fix the "role" issue in party.

09-21-2012
Fixed Boss Frames - ty screamie for figuring out a couple of the issues there 
	They are positioned in same place the basic blizz boss frames are located.
	Has castbar above frame
	Has debuffs below frame
Still working on Aurawatch but the bug for mages should be gone.
LFG roles still buggy. Reload UI when out of combat to get everything to show up right.

Changelog 09-10-2012
Changlog is now named changelog! Image that :)
Couple new config options- Show party frames horizontally
Target Debuffs- everyone else's debuffs are now desaturated again. /cheer!
Turned back off the ugly pvp icons until I can make something better- perhaps just H or A instead of an icon.

Changelog 09-02-2012
Fixed line 71 for good this time!
Added back percentage for target since it was requested

Changelog 8-30-2012
Fixed Aura watch error
Refixed yesterdays fix :)

Changelog 8-29-2012
Fixed: party/raid frames issues - I think.
Added: Show self in party option & Hide raid frame manager option... I know some people want to see this.

Changelog 8-22-2012
Big thanks to Paopao001 for helping with Warlock bar issues. They are fixed. Tukz Warlock bar plugin is embedded.
Nothing else noticable.

Changelog 8-01-2012
Removed dependency for Monks, Priests and Warlocks for their bars. You do not need Tukz plugins anymore.
Sorry Demo I'm still failing at your bar.
Couple different typo fixes.
Fixed - I think - whatever issue was going on with castbar - all 3 of them.
Released addistant, masterlooter, leader icons since oUF updated.
Couple different typo fixes.

Changelog 7-31-2012:
Fixed Holy Power bar - TY to Screamie for pointing out the prob

Changelog 7-26-2012:
Warlock resource bars: Fixed - sorta Demonology is not working- I do not play a warlock so if you have any ideas guys feel free to shoot them my way.
